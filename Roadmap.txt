## Roadmap to “realism-first” alternate Earth AI (5000 BCE to modern)

This is ordered by dependency and realism impact. Each phase ends with clear “done when” checks.

---

## Phase 0: Stability and de-rail the sim (easy, high impact)

**Do first.** This stops fake outcomes and makes later work meaningful.

1. Fix correctness bugs that block progression

* Unique tech IDs (your duplicate ID breaks progression)
* Re-enable civic tech requirements
* Stop zeroing culture remainder after unlock
* Replace `rand()` with seeded RNG for determinism

2. Remove hard rails that force history

* Delete year-based expansion caps
* Remove any “magic” growth/expansion spikes tied to time

**Done when**

* Same seed produces same world every run
* Tech and civics unlock as intended
* Empires can rise and fall without calendar forcing

Difficulty: easy

---

## Phase 1: Core AI driver, pressures + constraints (medium, massive impact)

**This is the heart of hands-off realism.** It replaces babysitting with hard rules.

Add per-polity pressures (scalars)

* survival, revenue, legitimacy, opportunity

Add constraints (scalars)

* admin capacity, fiscal capacity, logistics reach

Add an action chooser (every N years)
Generic actions only:

* invest admin, invest infra, tax reform, trade policy, fortify, raid, expand locally, sue for peace, alliance, repress, decentralize, invest health, invest education

No colonization action yet. That comes later as “external projection” once it is feasible.

**Done when**

* States behave sensibly without scripts: poor states seek revenue, threatened states arm, unstable states reform or repress
* You can remove most random war triggers and still see conflict

Difficulty: medium

---

## Phase 2: Control field and state churn (medium-hard, fixes immortal countries)

This is what makes 5000 BCE tags not survive to 2025 CE.

1. Distance-based control

* Control decays with distance, terrain cost, low infrastructure, low admin
* Low control reduces tax take, increases revolt risk, slows military response

2. Polity birth, death, and tag replacement

* Fragmentation into successor states when control collapses
* Annexation deletes polities instead of leaving ghosts
* Tag replacement when a new ruling coalition dominates core regions

3. Minimal factions (keep it light)

* 3 to 5 factions with power and satisfaction (land elites, merchants, clergy, military, urban)
* Low satisfaction drives coups, civil wars, decentralization

**Done when**

* Median polity lifespan in early eras is centuries, not millennia
* Borders change often early, stabilize mid, then can destabilize again later

Difficulty: medium-hard

---

## Phase 3: Spatial population and cities (hard, required for “humans on Earth” feel)

You cannot get realism without people living in places.

1. Population per econ cell or per city node

* Births and deaths depend on local food and disease pressure
* Migration responds to crowding, income proxy, safety

2. Cities as first-class objects

* City population, market access, specialization
* Innovation and state capacity growth scale with urban population

**Done when**

* River/coast-like corridors (even if fake for now) become dense
* You see urban cores, frontiers, and depopulated war zones

Difficulty: hard

---

## Phase 4: Economy and trade that obey constraints (hard, second biggest realism lever)

Keep it lightweight but stop “diffusion trade.”

1. Sector split (minimum)

* food vs non-food (later add energy/materials/services)

2. Conserved accounting

* output, consumption, investment, depreciation
* government extraction and spending are explicit

3. Directed trade with transport cost

* surplus goes to deficits if price gap beats cost
* ports and routes matter
* this plugs into your logistics reach

**Done when**

* Ports and chokepoints matter
* Landlocked interiors are poorer unless they build routes
* Trade collapses during war and causes real shortages

Difficulty: hard

---

## Phase 5: Replace science points and culture points (medium, high realism)

Do this after cities and economy exist so the drivers are real.

Science replacement

* innovation_rate from surplus + urban pop + education + stability
* diffusion_gain from contact (trade, borders, war)
* domains (6 to 10) feed tech unlock thresholds

Culture replacement

* slow traits at people layer
* institutions as adoption dynamics with transition costs and feasibility gates
* reforms selected by pressures, not currency spending

**Done when**

* Tribes do not “save points” and leap unrealistically
* Connected regions converge faster than isolated ones
* State capacity and institutions become the main limiter

Difficulty: medium

---

## Phase 6: Climate and weather integration (medium-hard, big realism payoff)

Do this once the sim consumes “environment multipliers” cleanly.

1. Environment fields interface first (so it is a plug-in)

* temp_mean, precip_mean, seasonality, disease_pressure, movement_cost
* yield multipliers derived from those

2. Simple climatology generator

* latitude bands + distance-to-coast continentality
* simple moisture advection along prevailing winds

3. Weather anomalies (yearly or seasonal)

* correlated drought and flood years
* feed into food output, migration, legitimacy, conflict risk

**Done when**

* Coasts are milder, interiors harsher
* Subtropical belts tend to be drier
* Drought years trigger migrations and collapses sometimes

Difficulty: medium-hard

---

## Phase 7: Exploration and colonization as emergent behavior (medium)

Now colonization appears naturally.

1. Known world and route knowledge

* exploration expands map knowledge and reduces route risk

2. External projection ladder

* trade outpost -> fort -> colony
* only chosen when opportunity pressure is high and maritime logistics + finance + rivalry make it worthwhile

3. Colonial autonomy mechanics

* distance control and local elites can produce independence

**Done when**

* You see trade posts first, then forts, then settlement colonies
* Colonial collapse and independence can happen without scripts

Difficulty: medium

---

## Phase 8: Calibration harness and realism targets (easy-medium, locks in quality)

This is how you keep accuracy without babysitting.

Add batch runs and check distributions:

* polity lifespans by era
* share of territory changing per century
* city size distribution heavy-tail
* trade gravity pattern proxy
* preindustrial per-capita bounded until energy transition

**Done when**

* You can change parameters and immediately see if realism drifted

Difficulty: easy-medium

---

## Phase 9: Performance, GPU placement, and polish (ongoing, last)

Move what is hot to GPU after the logic is correct:
GPU-best

* environment fields, disease spread, control/supply reach, migration pressure, grid production

CPU-best

* factions, budgets, diplomacy, war goals, peace deals, tag replacement, exploration graph

**Done when**

* Mega time jump stays fast and stable
* Results look consistent across long runs

Difficulty: ongoing

---

## What to do first vs last, in one line

**First:** remove rails and bugs, add pressures + constraints AI, add control field and churn.
**Last:** full climate realism, exploration/colonization ladder, heavy economy detail, then performance tuning.

This ordering solves your current biggest realism issue early (immortal states), then builds upward toward believable human geography, economics, and finally climate and overseas expansion.
