1) What is already implemented from research (and when)
================================================================

[x] Settlement nodes + fission

- Code:
  - include/settlement_system.h
  - src/settlement_system.cpp
- First implementation timestamp in workspace files: 2026-02-13

[x] Subsistence mixes + domestic packages
- Research mapping:
  - "Subsistence mixes and domesticate packages"
  - Eq14 coupling (market potential vs subsistence risk -> specialist share)
- Code:
  - include/domestic_packages.h
  - src/domestic_packages.cpp
  - src/settlement_system.cpp
- First implementation timestamp in workspace files: 2026-02-13

[x] Transport-cost network + settlement migration/trade flows
- Research mapping:
  - "Transport-cost network", "Migration and mobility regimes", "Trade caravans..."
  - Eq12 (migration) and Eq13 (gravity trade), supporting Eq14 dynamics

- First implementation timestamp in workspace files: 2026-02-13

[x] GPU research kernels (disease, climate/fertility, adoption/join, edge logistics)
- Research mapping:
  - Eq15..Eq23 (disease), Eq18/Eq19 (climate/fertility), Eq24 (join/stay utility), Eq25/Eq27/Eq28 (logistics), Eq26 (adoption), acceleration for Eq12/Eq13 edge terms

  - src/settlement_system.cpp
  - data/sim_config.toml
- First implementation timestamp in workspace files: 2026-02-14

[x] Enabled by default
- Change:
  - settlements default changed from OFF to ON
  - research GPU toggles defaulted ON (with CPU fallback when unavailable)
- Code/config:
  - include/simulation_context.h
  - src/simulation_context.cpp
  - data/sim_config.toml
- Date: 2026-02-14

================================================================
2) Coverage status vs equation set (Eq01..Eq28)
================================================================

[Done] Eq01..Eq08
- Settlement growth/fission loop is implemented.

[Partial] Eq09, Eq10, Eq11
- Extraction/revenue/legitimacy exists mainly at country macro layer.
- Missing for full match: tighter settlement-level fiscal linkage and explicit settlement-to-polity aggregation in equation form.

[Done] Eq12, Eq13
- Settlement migration/trade over transport-cost graph is implemented.

[Partial] Eq14
- Specialist-share dynamics implemented in settlement system.
- Could be tightened with richer market potential and broader class/institution feedback.

[Partial/Done] Eq15, Eq16, Eq17, Eq20, Eq21, Eq22, Eq23
- Settlement-scale network-coupled SIR with imported infection is implemented (GPU + CPU fallback).
- Still simplified versus full research detail/calibration.

[Partial/Done] Eq18, Eq19
- Climate-regime transitions and fertility stock updates are implemented (GPU + CPU fallback).
- Still simplified versus full irrigation-capital and agronomy detail.

[Partial] Eq24
- Settlement-level join/stay utility is implemented and fed into polity legitimacy/control.
- Missing for full match: explicit multi-polity assignment optimization.

[Partial] Eq25, Eq27, Eq28
- Edge-level logistics attenuation and war-risk effects are implemented (GPU + CPU fallback).
- Missing for full match: campaign route-segment cumulative deficit/attrition.

[Partial/Done] Eq26
- Settlement-network adoption probability pass is implemented (GPU + CPU fallback).
- Still simplified in multi-package competition/institutional coupling.

================================================================
3) Coverage status vs SimulationResearch subsystem roadmap
================================================================

[Done] Settlement nodes and fission
[Done] Subsistence mixes and domesticate package mechanics
[Done] Transport-cost interaction network (trade/migration)
[Partial] Households/elites/extraction capacity
[Partial/Done] Institutions and technology diffusion as network process
[Partial] State formation from settlement systems (join/stay implemented; explicit polity-choice layer still missing)
[Partial] Warfare and campaign logistics (edge logistics done; full route-segment deficit model pending)
[Partial/Done] Settlement-scale network-coupled epidemics
[Partial/Done] Multi-year climate regimes (Markov-like) as explicit regime state
[Partial] Soil fertility stock + irrigation capital loop in explicit form
[Missing] Pastoral mobility routes (seasonal route layer)

================================================================
4) GPU candidate backlog (refined from SimulationResearch + equations)
================================================================

Priority P1

[x] P1-A Settlement disease network kernel (Eq15-17, Eq20-23)
- Implemented.

[x] P1-B Settlement flow kernel acceleration (Eq12/Eq13 edge terms)
- Implemented.

[Partial] P1-C Transport-cost recompute acceleration
- Edge-kernel acceleration is implemented.
- Full field-level path/graph rebuild acceleration is still pending.

Priority P2

[x] P2-A Climate regime field kernel (Eq18) + fertility kernel (Eq19)
- Implemented.

[x] P2-B Settlement-level adoption probability kernel (Eq26)
- Implemented.

Priority P3

[Partial] P3-A Warfare route logistics kernel (Eq25, Eq27, Eq28)
- Edge-level attenuation is implemented.
- Route-segment campaign supply model remains.

[Partial] P3-B Settlement join/stay polity kernel (Eq24)
- Join/stay utility kernel and macro feedback are implemented.
- Explicit polity assignment optimization remains.

[ ] P3-C Pastoral seasonal mobility routes
- Not implemented.

================================================================
5) Practical next build order
================================================================

Recommended sequence:
1. P1-C full transport recompute acceleration (field/path rebuild)
2. P3-A full warfare route logistics (route-segment campaign supply)
3. P3-B full polity assignment optimization on top of join/stay utility
4. P3-C pastoral seasonal mobility routes

This sequence keeps risk low and focuses remaining realism/performance gaps.
