For your info, we are trying to build a simulation. A world simulation model. We are dropping in humans in 5000
BCE and trying to seee what societies and all evolve.

If you need to build, use the command "build.bat release"

If you do fine tuning, make sure to add your log and date it to the TUNINGLOG.MD file!
